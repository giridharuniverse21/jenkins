# Jenkins download and deployment 
The Jenkins project produces two release lines: Stable (LTS) and regular (Weekly). Depending on your organization's needs, one may be preferred over the other. See the links below for more information and recommendations about the release lines.

> Stable (LTS) 
>>Long-Term Support (LTS) release baselines are chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases. Every 4 weeks we release stable releases which include bug and security fix backports. [Learn more.](https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/).

NOTE: Packages with the gear icon are maintained by third parties. Such packages may be not as frequently updated as packages supported by the Jenkins project directly.

# Deploying Jenkins in public cloud
Many public cloud vendors provide their own Jenkins installation guides and packages. The guides provide instructions to deploy, maintain, and upgrade on the specific public cloud. Such guides may be used to quickly deploy Jenkins and, in many cases, to get an instance preconfigured to be used within the public cloud (e.g. bundled plugins, integrations with public cloud services, etc.).
